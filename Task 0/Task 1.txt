1. What is faster in execution, a low-level programming language or a high-level programming language?
	A low-level langauge because there are less steps, but it's harder to program because you have to program intructions in 	assmebler. (Page 11)

2. How many different values can be built with a nibble?
	A nibble is a combination of four 0s or 1s, so the ammount of combinations is equal to 2^4=16. That means that there are 16 	different values. (Page 13, lines 3-4)

3. What is greater, a 1 KB or 1Kb?
	A kilobyte (KB) is equal to a 10^3 value, and a kilobyte (Kb) is equal to 2^10 value. Beacause of that fact, kilobytes (Kb) are 	greater than kilobytes (KB) as 10^3 = 1000 < 1024 = 2^10 . (Page 16)

4. What kind of error are:
	1. sin(x) = 33
		The value of a sin(x) function can't be define because it isn't a variable.
	2. x = sin(33
		The sin() function returns a double value, because it is designed to be able to represent a wide range of values, 			including very small and very large values. So the correct way would be this:
			double x = sin(33.0);
		
5. Is C an interpreted language?
	No, owing to the fact that C needs a compilar to be executed. (Pages 81-86)

6. Can you copy the files in here and compile and execute each of them? 
	Yes, I can. I have also recorded a video executing then.
